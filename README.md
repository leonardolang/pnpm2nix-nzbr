Provides a `mkPnpmPackage` function that can be used to build a pnpm package with nix.

The function can be accessed either by importing this repo as a flake input or though `pkgs.callPackage /path/to/this/repo/derivation.nix {}`.

In addition to all arguments accepted by `stdenv.mkDerivation`, the `mkPnpmPackage` function accepts the following arguments:

## Internals

The supplied `pnpmLockYaml` is processed using a lot of (slow) IFD logic.
To cache those results more efficiently, pass it explicitly as `pnpmLockYaml = ./pnpm-lock.yaml`.
